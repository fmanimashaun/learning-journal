# Scrimba - Food order app solution

The project was built to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a food ordering app based on the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mJyp4LkSPFc3DUtoHBehHf/Mobile-Restaurant-Menu-(Copy)) design. This is part of the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path solo projects.
