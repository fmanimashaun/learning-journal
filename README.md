## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

The project was built to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a learning journal website based on the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/HX22f5YqABC0Yi8XQaE2NW/Learning-Journal%2FBlog) design. This is part of the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path solo projects.

### What I learned <a name="what-i-learned"></a>

Basically, I worked to reinforced my knowledge of interpreting UI/UX design and implemeenting the  layout as close as possible to the design.

### Continued development <a name="continued-development"></a>

I will still want to focus on reinforcing my understanding of various layout implementation while learning javascript for use in future projects
