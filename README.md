# Scrimba - Learning Journal Blog

The project was built to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a learning journal website based on the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/HX22f5YqABC0Yi8XQaE2NW/Learning-Journal%2FBlog) design. This is part of the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path solo projects.
